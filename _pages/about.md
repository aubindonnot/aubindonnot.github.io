I am a Eng.D Student in optical communications at G&H (Torquay, UK) & University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, UK), working with Peter Kean Craig Michie & Gordon Flockhart. My research interests are high power optical fibre amplifiers for space based optical communications. In particular, improving the efficiency of existing systems and answering the challenges of space.

I received my Masters of Science from Heriot-Watt University and Masters of Engineering Degrees from IPSA (Paris), both in 2020.
