Hi! I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Northeastern University Khoury College of Computer Sciences in the San Francisco Bay Area campuses! I received my PhD in computer science from NYU Tandon in 2022 under my advisor [Damon McCoy](http://damonmccoy.com). 
My pronouns are she/her.


My main research interests are cybersecurity, ethics, social bias in machine learning, and teaching ethical computing. 
I strongly believe that the most efficient path to ethical tech is to have computer/data scientists who reflect the population that their products are designed to affect. 
Please feel free to reach out to me to talk about teaching, ethical computing, or online harassment! 

I am learning Spanish and Mandarin, and I would love to practice with you!
